These assignments were part of a graduate level data science class. Taught by Matt Ross, Caitlyn Mothes, and Katie Willie. This class was taken as part of my required Ecosystem Science and Sustainability coursework for the Professional Science Masters. I am currently enrolled in the second half of this course where we are working on writing a report, and conducting a data analysis on cropland diversity and farm size in the United States. This portion of the course is taught by Nathan Mueller.

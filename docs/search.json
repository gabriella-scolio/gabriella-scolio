This project uses IPCC Tier 1 methods to calculate emissions associated with California Dairy operations in 2018,2020, and 2022.\nThis project will have a secondary part that will outline a mitigation analysis , based on linear regression extrapolation from historical data.\nTo complete this project a function was created in R which generated total emissions from dairy operations and had arguments for number of cows, counties and associated IPCC emission factors. Uncertainty was accounted for and a monte carlo analysis was performed to calculate these emission estimates to include uncertainty.\n\n\nCalifornia.Results.Total<- \"DairyEmissions\"(input.filename= \"545_ef_data.csv\",county=48, nyears= 3 ,iseed=208784, nreps = 10000 , ef= 128, ef1= 58, ef3=.005,ef5=.0075, ef4=.01, ms=.263,\nnex=97.0024, fracgas.ms=0.3, fracgas.n=.2 , EF01= .03, fracleach=.3) \n\n\n\n# input.filename - Name of file with activity data, which is a comma delimited file with the input activity data in columns along with a header row as follows: Number of Cows, and all emission factors with standard deviation, max CO2 emissions factor, CH4 emission factor, min CH4 emission, max CH4 emission factor, N2O emission factor, min N2O emission factor, max N2O emissions factor, fuel amount for year 1 (TJ), standard deviation for fuel amount, . . . for all years #county Number of counties in input file #nyears Number of years of data\n#iseed Initial seed value for random draws\n#nreps Number of Monte Carlo iterations #ef EF from table 10.11 Enteric Fermentation\n#ef1 Ef from table 10.14 Manure Mgmt\n#ef3 Ef from table 10.21 Manure Mgmt\n#ef4 Ef from table 11.3 Soil N20\n#ef5 Ef from table 11.3 Soil N20\n#EF01 Ef from table 11.1 Soil N20\n#ms fraction of total annual nitrogen excretion for each livestock species/category T that is managed\nin manure management system S in the country, dimensionless #nex annual average N excretion per head of species/category T in the country, kg N animal-1 yr-1, equation 10.30\n#fracgas.ms percent of managed manure nitrogen for livestock category T that volatilises as NH3 and NOx in the manure management system S, %, Table 10.22 #fracgas.n Volatilisation from all organic N fertilisers applied, Table # 11.3\n#frac leach Leach/Runoff from all organic N fertilisers applied, Table 11.3"
